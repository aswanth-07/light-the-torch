# üöÄ My PyTorch Learning Journey

Welcome to my PyTorch learning repository! This is my personal notebook vault as I work through the fantastic **[Zero to Mastery: Learn PyTorch for Deep Learning](https://www.learnpytorch.io/)** course.

The main goal?  
To organize everything I learn ‚Äî from basic tensor operations to building neural networks ‚Äî in one place. It‚Äôs my go-to hub for revisiting concepts, tracking progress, and sharing what I‚Äôve built.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

Here's how this repo is structured:

- `datasets/` ‚Äì Datasets used throughout the course (or links to where to get them).
- `models/` ‚Äì PyTorch model files or saved model checkpoints.
- `notebooks/` ‚Äì The core learning notebooks (Jupyter format).
- `requirements.txt` ‚Äì All the Python packages needed to run the notebooks.
- `README.md` ‚Äì You‚Äôre reading it right now!

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Usage

Want to try these notebooks locally? Here's how:

1. **Clone this repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aswanth-07/pytorch-learning-journey.git
   cd pytorch-learning-journey
   ```

2. **(Optional but recommended) Set up a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install required packages:**
   > First, make sure you've renamed `requirements.txt.txt` to `requirements.txt` if needed.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook or Lab:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   # or
   jupyter lab
   ```

5. Head into the `notebooks/` folder and open the notebook you want!

## ‚úçÔ∏è Notes & Reflections

Here‚Äôs where I‚Äôll occasionally jot down thoughts or things that stood out:

- PyTorch‚Äôs dynamic nature makes experimentation feel intuitive and clean.
- The `.to(device)` concept (CPU/GPU flexibility) was a game-changer for writing portable code.
- Loved the visual explanations ‚Äî they really helped me internalize tensor broadcasting and model flow.
- So far, the course structure has been solid ‚Äî practical and beginner-friendly, with just the right touch of theory.
- The `torch.inference_mode()` context manager is a clean way to ensure no gradients are calculated during evaluation or testing.
- Grasping the standard training loop (forward pass, loss calculation, zero gradients, backward pass, optimizer step) is fundamental for building and training models.
- PyTorch's `nn.Module` and `nn.Parameter` provide a powerful and flexible way to define custom models and their learnable parameters.
- Saving and loading model states with `torch.save()` and `load_state_dict()` is straightforward for model persistence and sharing.
